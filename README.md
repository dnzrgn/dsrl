# Deep Spiking Reinforcement Learning
Implementations of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms with
Spiking Neural Netowrks (SNNs) in PyTorch. SNNs are based on the
SpyTorch implementations, with custom encoding and decoding mechanisms.

## Dependency installation
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Python 3.8.12. Creating a virtual environment is recommended.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
